                    Holden states in this chapter that he would like to be a catcher in the rye. Now what does this mean?<br><br>
                    Throughout the book, Holden has always seemed particuly fond of children.<br><br>
                    This is important to this because being a Catcher in the Rye means protecting the innocent of children.<br><br>
                    <h3>Now hear is the Reasoning</h3><br>
                    Holden states "I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff".<br><br>
                    This is a symbolic refrence to protecting a child's youth, Holden wants to make sure the kids stay innocent and keep happily playing for as log as he can.<br><br>
                    The whole book is about this, like when Holden helps the little girl with he skates and is happy that she is playing. Holden wishes he could still be that kid<br><br> 
                    At the end of the chapter, Phoebe states that she is taking "bleching lessons". This shows Phoebe's youth and how care free she is. The main reason that Holden likes her<br><br>
