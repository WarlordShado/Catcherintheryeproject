		<p id="Summary"> 
			Holden went to Phoebe's room and she was still crying about how Holden got kicked out of school. She kept reapeating "Daddy'll kill you".<br><br>
			Holden says the worse thing his dad can do is send him to a military camp <br><br>
			Phoebe asks Holden if he passed any subjects and says he only passed english <br><br>
			Phoebe asked why Holden got kicked out of another school, states the school is full of phonies<br><br>
			Holden says that didn't like the Veterans Day ceremony at Pency <br><br>
			He states that they are a bunch of phonies because they liked Pency and he can't see why they would enjoy it <br><br>
			Phoebe states that Holden doesn't like anything and asks him to name one thing he likes <br><br>
			Holden starts thinking about James Castle, a boy who killed himself. (More Info on Characters Page)<br><br>
			Holden also started thinking about the Nuns from earlier in the book (Again Character Page) <br><br>
			He doesn't say either of these things and brings up his dead brother Allie (Character Page) as something he likes <br><br>
			Phoebe says he can't like him beacuse he is dead and that angers Holden <br><br>
			Phoebe asks what Holden would like to do when he is older <br><br>
			She asks if he wants to be a lawyer and Holden goes on a tangent about how he doesn't like lawyers <br><br>
			Holden says that he wants to be a Catcher in the Rye (More info on Other Info Page) from that one poem <br><br>
			Holden then states that he is going to meet up with an old teacher <br><br>
			It ends off in a non-aggresive stance with Phoebe saying she was taking belching lessons at school (Relates to the title of the book) <br><br>
